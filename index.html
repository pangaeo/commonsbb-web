                <h2>Why Commons Baseball Exists</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Let's start with the obvious: <strong>card games are fun. Baseball is fun. Game nights unplugged are
                    fun.</strong> Building a deck that you can play with, strategizing over which cards to include, tweaking
                your lineup - that's all part of the joy.</p>
        
            <p>If you're a card collector, you know the feeling - boxes of old commons sitting around that are "worthless" by
                market standards, but somehow you can't throw them away. Maybe it's the nostalgia. Maybe it's the faint hope
                they'll be worth something someday. Maybe it's just that these cards are <em>cool</em> - great photographs,
                interesting stats, and fun trivia on the backs. Did you know Dick Tidrow of the Cubs in 1980 was affectionately
                nicknamed "Mr. Dirt"?</p>
        
            <p>The idea of using baseball cards and dice to simulate games isn't new. There have been some really good games
                created over the years, and some of them are still around today. But here's the thing: they tend to fall into
                two camps.</p>
        
            <p><strong>The hyper-realistic camp:</strong> These games are incredibly detailed simulations that capture every
                nuance of baseball. They're fantastic if you love complexity, but can be overwhelming for casual play or 
                introducing new players.</p>
        
            <p><strong>The simple-but-inaccurate camp:</strong> These games are easy to learn and quick to play, but they
                sacrifice the statistical accuracy that makes player cards meaningful. When every 1983 common plays roughly the
                same, what's the point of using real cards?</p>
        
            <p><strong>What was missing?</strong> A game that was simple enough to play with just one die and finish in a
                reasonable time, but accurate enough to reflect the true performance of players from the season their card
                represents. A game where a Hall of Fame season actually feels dominant, where a .220 hitter struggles, and where
                that random utility infielder who had a career year in 1987 gets their moment to shine.</p>
        
            <p>Commons Baseball fills that gap. It's the sweet spot between "too complex" and "too simple" - accessible enough
                for a casual game night, realistic enough that the stats matter, and built specifically to give those forgotten
                commons a purpose.</p>
        
            <p>This game combines the pure joy of playing a simple tabletop card game with the excitement of rediscovering old
                cards you haven't thought about in years. It rewards you for digging through your collection to find hidden gems
                - players who had great seasons but never became household names. It makes you appreciate baseball history in a
                new way.</p>
        
            <p><strong>That's why Commons Baseball exists:</strong> to bring your cards back to life, to give commons their day
                in the sun, and to prove that the best game nights don't need a screen.</p>

                <h2>Simple & Accessible</h2>
                <p>The game uses statistics from the backs of your cards to create a realistic baseball simulation that you can play
                head-to-head or solo. Most households already have a six-sided die, which is all you need to roll. No app required, no
                special equipment - just you, your cards, and a d6.</p>
                <p>The Commons Baseball app looks up your players by year and calculates the dice roll probabilities for you. Once you have
                     built your roster, you can print out the dice roll probabilities either for card sleeve inserts or Avery label stickers,
                     and after that you can play the game entirely analog.</p>
